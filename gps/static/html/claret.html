                St. Claret matric Hr. Secondary school is the school where I completed my higher secondary education.
                It is a private un-aided school.
                The infrastructure of the campus is quite impressive.
                The teachers are very kind and the teaching is excellent.
                Furthermore they also give importance to sports specifically to football.
                They also teach other extra curricular activites such as
                dance, music, yoga and karate.
                The fees structure of the school is very genuine and affordable.
                I thoroughly enjoyed my days while I was studying here.
