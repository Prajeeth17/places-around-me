An audience member's senses come alive the moment they enter a movie theater. 
The smell of the food, the sounds from the arcade, the sweet taste of a cold soda, 
the greasy feeling of butter on one's popcorn, and 
the movie itself are just a few of the things that will manipulate one's senses. 
The lines may irk a person, but once they are inside it is well worth it. 
The theater is a happening place to be for people of all ages. The feeling of 
all of one's senses being used is invigorating which promotes the theater's popularity.
This theatre has 2 screens which has a resolution of 720p and they are also 3d
