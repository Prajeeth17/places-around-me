The name Thiruninravur comes from the Tamil words Thiru, nindra and vur. 
The Tamil word Thiru represents the name for the Hindu god Perumal. 
Nindra refers to stood and vur refers to a village or a place. 
It is said that Lakshmi was travelling through the sky and saw this beautiful village and stood here; 
she wondered how beautiful is this village.
Thus the place came to be known as Thiru-ninra-vur, the village where Lakshmi-Narayana stood.
