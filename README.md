                St. Claret matric Hr. Secondary school is the school where I completed my higher secondary education.
                It is a private un-aided school.
                The infrastructure of the campus is quite impressive.
                The teachers are very kind and the teaching is excellent.
                Furthermore they also give importance to sports specifically to football.
                They also teach other extra curricular activites such as
                dance, music, yoga and karate.
                The fees structure of the school is very genuine and affordable.
                I thoroughly enjoyed my days while I was studying here.

The name Thiruninravur comes from the Tamil words Thiru, nindra and vur. 
The Tamil word Thiru represents the name for the Hindu god Perumal. 
Nindra refers to stood and vur refers to a village or a place. 
It is said that Lakshmi was travelling through the sky and saw this beautiful village and stood here; 
she wondered how beautiful is this village.
Thus the place came to be known as Thiru-ninra-vur, the village where Lakshmi-Narayana stood.

An audience member's senses come alive the moment they enter a movie theater. 
The smell of the food, the sounds from the arcade, the sweet taste of a cold soda, 
the greasy feeling of butter on one's popcorn, and 
the movie itself are just a few of the things that will manipulate one's senses. 
The lines may irk a person, but once they are inside it is well worth it. 
The theater is a happening place to be for people of all ages. The feeling of 
all of one's senses being used is invigorating which promotes the theater's popularity.
This theatre has 2 screens which has a resolution of 720p and they are also 3d
